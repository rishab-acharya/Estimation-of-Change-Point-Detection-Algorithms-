# Simulation Study for Change Point Detection in Time Series

This repository contains a collection of R scripts developed as part of my dissertation. The simulation study focuses on evaluating change point detection methods for time series data. Three families of methods are considered:

1. **Change in Mean Detection** using `cpt.mean`
2. **Change in Variance Detection** using `cpt.var`
3. **Change in Mean and Variance Detection** using `cpt.meanvar`

Different detection methods (PELT and BinSeg) and various penalty criteria (AIC, BIC, MBIC) are applied. The study involves simulating piecewise-stationary data with known change points and evaluating the performance of each method.

## Repository Structure

- **PBS-SCP-MEAN.R**  
  - **Purpose:** Single change point (SCP) detection in mean.  
  - **Highlights:**  
    - Simulates data with two segments (one mean shift).
    - Implements single change point detection using `cpt.mean` with both PELT and BinSeg (with Q set to 1).
    - Includes repeated simulation functions and sensitivity analyses (with and without MAD normalization).
  - **Example Code:**  
    ```r
    fit <- cpt.mean(data_vector, method = "PELT", penalty = "BIC")
    cpts(fit)  # Extracts the change point index
    ```
